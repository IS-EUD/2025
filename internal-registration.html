            <p>In the registration system the prices are a combination of
            registration cost that is subject to 19% VAT (in German
            Umsatzsteuerpflichtig) and registration cost not subject to VAT (in
            German nicht Umsatzsteuerpflichtig) due to German tax reason. On the
            registration you pick your category (regular or student) and then
            the additional item is added automatically. The total price of both
            parts is the price shown above and it can only booked together.</p>

            elements of conference including Workshops, Doctoral Consortium,
