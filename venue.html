			current projects, share findings, and discuss methods and tools: from
			hardware prototyping and virtual environments to robots and
			physiological data collection.</p>
		<p>We look forward to lively conversations with colleagues from the HCI
			community and are excited to provide insights into our research
			environment and collaborations at LMU Munich.</p>

		<h3 id="public-transport">Public Transport</h3>
		<p>
			To get around in Munich we recommend public transport
			(
			<a href="https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/" target="_blank">https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/
			</a>
			). In most cases this is the fastest option. To get to the venue by public
			transport you can go by to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Munich main railway station (München Hauptbahnhof / München Hbf) which is
				connected by Tram, U-Bahn, S-Bahn, regional trains, and long distance trains.
				From the station it is less than 10 minutes to walk to the venue.
			</li>
			<li>U-Bahn Station Sendlinger Tor is well connected to the U-Bahn network and
				also a 10 minute walk to the venue.
			</li>
			<li>A further option is Karlsplatz/Stachus (served by Tram, U-Bahn, and S-Bahn)
				which is also less than 10 minutes to walk.
			</li>
		</ul>
