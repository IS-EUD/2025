### Walking, Bikes, Scooters

Munich is a walkable city. There are many different companies offering bike sharing (e.g. Call a bike, <https://www.callabike.de/en/home> and MVV bikes <https://www.mvg.de/ueber-die-mvg/unsere-fahrzeuge/mvg-rad.html>) as well as e-scooters (e.g. Lime <https://www.li.me/de-de/>, Bold <https://bolt.eu/de-de/scooters/>, and Tier <https://www.tier.app/en/>) â€“ all of these require apps for use.
