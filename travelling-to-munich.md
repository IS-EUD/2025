### Travelling to Munich 

- Munich main railway station is linked by long distance trains (international and national), by night trains, and by regional trains. See German rail for your connection (<https://int.bahn.de/en>)
- Arriving by plane to Munich Airport (MUC) we recommend the S-Bahn (S1 or S8) or the Lufthansa Bus. All will stop at the main railway station and it takes about 40-60 minutes to get from the airport to the city. A single one way ticket from the airport to the city is 14,30€. For details and tickets see <https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/>. There is also an APP (<https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/journey-planer/mobile-services/mvv-app/>)
- If you come by car, be aware that parking in the city is expensive (30€ or more per day). There are several parking garages close to the conference venue. The parking Sonnenhof-Garage Tiefgarage (Landwehrstraße 10, 80336 München) is just 2 minutes walk away. <https://maps.app.goo.gl/uH6aHFkEeCtKGdN26>
