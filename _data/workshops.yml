    This workshop explores human-AI collaboration in decision-making,
    emphasizing a human-centered approach to AI design. Symbiotic AI enhances
    human skills rather than replacing them, aligning with best practices from
    human-computer interaction. While AI offers valuable support, challenges
    like bias, over-reliance, and interpretability persist, affecting trust,
    fairness, and ethics. To address these concerns, the workshop integrates
    HCI, AI, ethics, law, software engineering, and end-user development.
    Through discussions and knowledge exchange, participants will examine key
    aspects of human-AI symbiosis in decision-making, particularly in fields
    like medicine, fostering more effective, ethical, and trustworthy AI systems
    that enhance human capabilities.

    Cybersecurity education faces major challenges due to evolving threats and a
    shortage of skilled professionals. Strengthening collaboration between
    industry, academia, and public administration is key to developing
    innovative training methods that equip students, professionals, and
    non-experts with essential cybersecurity skills. Building on the success of
    previous editions, CSE4IA2025 will examine how End-User Development (EUD),
    AI-driven learning, and low-code/no-code approaches can enhance
    cybersecurity education. The workshop will bring together researchers and
    practitioners to discuss user-centered learning environments that help
    end-users understand and mitigate security risks, fostering
    interdisciplinary collaboration to redefine cybersecurity education with
    innovative, user-friendly solutions.

    This 9th edition of the CoPDA workshop aims to explore the intersection of
    sustainability and cultures of participation in diverse contexts. As
    participatory cultures become central to addressing complex global
    challenges (as defined by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and
    its 17 Sustainable Development Goals), they require robust sustainability
    frameworks to ensure their long-term viability. This workshop will examine
    how environmental, social, economic, technological, and cultural
    sustainability principles can inform and enhance participatory systems by
    supporting community-driven design with end-user development. Participants
    will engage in interactive sessions to identify and discuss strategies for
    fostering evolution, adaptability, and educational innovation within
    cultures of participation.

  abstract: >-
    This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners in EUD,
    AI-assisted development, and Human-Computer interaction to explore how we
    can utilize GenAI to give end-user developers tools that maintain the
    expressiveness of modern programming languages, are accessible and
    approachable but also allow end users to create high-quality, reliable
    software without requiring extensive software engineering expertise.
    Through the contributions of the workshop participants and hands-on
    exploration of different paradigms and presentations, we will assess the
    status quo and chart a path forward toward an accessible, natural way to
    create software.
