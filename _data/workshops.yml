    This workshop explores human-AI collaboration in decision-making,
    emphasizing a human-centered approach to AI design. Symbiotic AI enhances
    human skills rather than replacing them, aligning with best practices from
    human-computer interaction. While AI offers valuable support, challenges
    like bias, over-reliance, and interpretability persist, affecting trust,
    fairness, and ethics. To address these concerns, the workshop integrates
    HCI, AI, ethics, law, software engineering, and end-user development.
    Through discussions and knowledge exchange, participants will examine key
    aspects of human-AI symbiosis in decision-making, particularly in fields
    like medicine, fostering more effective, ethical, and trustworthy AI systems
    that enhance human capabilities.

    Cybersecurity education faces major challenges due to evolving threats and a
    shortage of skilled professionals. Strengthening collaboration between
    industry, academia, and public administration is key to developing
    innovative training methods that equip students, professionals, and
    non-experts with essential cybersecurity skills. Building on the success of
    previous editions, CSE4IA2025 will examine how End-User Development (EUD),
    AI-driven learning, and low-code/no-code approaches can enhance
    cybersecurity education. The workshop will bring together researchers and
    practitioners to discuss user-centered learning environments that help
    end-users understand and mitigate security risks, fostering
    interdisciplinary collaboration to redefine cybersecurity education with
    innovative, user-friendly solutions.
